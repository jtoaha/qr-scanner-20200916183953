# PWA QR Code Scanner (built using the Ionic PWA framework using React)

There is a tutorial, "How to Build a PWA QR Code Scanner with Ionic for iOS & Android" [https://devdactic.com/pwa-qr-scanner-ionic/](https://devdactic.com/pwa-qr-scanner-ionic/)

However, that tutorial was built using Angular instead of React.

So this repository takes that code and converts it to React (Typescript)

**Status: In Progress as of 9/22/2020**

- Features that work so far:
  - Functioning QR Scanner on Web Cam and iPhone
  - Need to test on Android. It likely works there, as well.
- Need to polish up UI a bit and add more functionality, including option to allow user to add image.

**Important Note:** Will not work on Iphone/ Android through local hosting because of SSL issues. You'll need to run through https.
